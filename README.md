Here are my projects that I created while taking the Analyze Financial Data With Python Skill Path with Code Academy.
# Instructions about Capstone
Project 3: Capstone- Choosing portfolio for people. 


You are working as a wealth manager at a small firm where you have clients seeking advice on how to invest their money. A young client wants to invest a large amount of their savings in a portfolio of stocks, but they are unsure of what stocks to invest in and at what amounts.

In this capstone project, you will create a presentation that showcases a portfolio of stocks that you recommend your client invest in, and provide the weights at which they should invest in each stock depending on their risk preference.

The purpose of this capstone is to practice accessing and downloading financial data, calculating financial statistics to understand the individual performance of an asset and how groups of assets are related, and how to allocate investments across assets for optimal performance

Compared to the other projects you have completed thus far, we are requiring few restrictions on how you structure your code. The project is much more open-ended, and you should use your creativity. In addition, much of the code you write for later parts of this project will depend on how you decide to implement earlier parts. Therefore, we strongly encourage you to read through the entire assignment before writing any code.


Import/Download the Data

The financial data you use in this project is up to you. You can access financial data using one of the APIs accessed through the pandas-datareader package or from websites such as Yahoo Finance. Make sure to find data for at least, but not limited to, four (4) stocks to include in your analysis.

Load the data into a pandas DataFrame so you can easily view and manipulate the data.


Calculate Financial Statistics

Calculate some of the financial statistics you have learned about to gain insights into the stocks and how they relate to each other. What are the returns of the stocks over different time periods? How risky are each of the stocks when compared to each other? Do the returns of the stocks correlate with each other, or are they diversified?


Optimized Portfolio

Perform a mean-variance portfolio optimization that shows the efficient frontier for the group of stocks you have selected. If the investor is less risky, how should she allocate her funds across the portfolio? If she is more risky, how should she allocate her funds? Indicate multiple investment options at different risk levels and specify the returns.


Create Your Presentation

We want to see:

Share your Presentation

1. Save your presentation as a Google Slide or some other presentation format
2. Post your presentation on the Codecademy forum. More details describing how to post your code can be found in the following informational.
Good luck!

Now that you have completed the path projects, it’s time to get feedback!

Learners like you have also completed the projects and shared them on the Codecademy forum. It’s a safe space to get reviews, help, and learn from others.

Post your project – including any code, findings, and presentation materials – on the forum and ask for feedback.Depending on the nature of your project, posting may require sharing a link or adding an attachment with your files in the forum. Follow the instructions in your project for more specific advice.

Peer review can improve your coding skills and make you a better team-player. Here’s how to get the most out of the discussion:

- Clearly label your project with the path and project name.
- Ask for specific feedback, e.g. “Is there a more efficient way to query this data?”; “Do you agree with my findings?”
- Review your peers’ work too – you’ll be giving back to the community that helped you and you’ll get practice reviewing another developer’s code. Give both positive and critical feedback.
